# QQ_3D_Navier_Stokes_Conjecture_Simulator

ABOUT: A sophisticated 3D fluid dynamics simulator for visualizing and analyzing conceptual incompressible fluid flows, featuring real-time 3D rendering, detailed metrics, and AI-powered interpretation of phenomena like turbulence and vortex stretching.

CRITICAL NOTE FOR RESEARCHERS: This simulator provides a **conceptual visualization** of 3D incompressible fluid dynamics. It is **NOT** a direct, high-fidelity simulation of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations and cannot be used to prove or disprove the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness conjecture. Its purpose is for conceptual understanding of related phenomena.

BETA SOFTWARE NOTICE: This application is under active development. While we strive for numerical accuracy for the implemented PDE, bugs or unexpected behaviors may be present. Your use of this tool acknowledges its experimental status.
